    <section><h3>Critical</h3>

        <p>Critical reception to Kiryu's character has been generally positive. <a
            href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/06/yakuza-review">Juan Castro from IGN</a> praised him as an
        appealing character noting, both his violent traits as well as his kindness. They further noted that while
        being a "badass", he stands out thanks to his kindness. The same website listed him as a notorious anti-hero as
        he
        "walks a fine line between good and bad." <a
            href="https://www.cheatcc.com/psx2/rev/yakuzareview.html#ixzz2xFtxSCWe">Cheat Code Central</a> expressed
        similar comments noting that despite
        the character's occupation, he is so kind he takes the blame of Dojima's death in the start of the first
        game
        resulting in the expulsion from his family. <a
            href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_yakuza_ps2">Eurogamer</a> similarly commented that "Despite all
        the violence,
        Kazuma is quite a personable bloke, whose love for his friends sees him banged up for ten years over a
        murder
        his 'brother' Nishiki committed." <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140328204610/http://www.videogamer.com/ps2/yakuza/review.html">VideoGamer.com's
            Wesley Yin-Poole</a> also shared similar commenting adding
        that "Kazuma isn't averse to the odd spot of humanitarian work either - he's just a big softy really." Greg
        Orlando from the magazine <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061124041801/http://www.newtype-usa.com/reviews/index.php?itemid=315">Newtype</a>
        found him entertaining due to multiple actions he does across the series.
        When reviewing Yakuza 3, Sam Marchello from <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330004901/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/yakuza/yakuza3/reviews/yakuza3strev1.html">RPGamer</a>
        noted the character's notable development comparing his
        life
        with the Yakuza to the orphans. Greg Miller from IGN <a
            href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/yakuza-3-review?page=2">noted</a> how developers wanted
        players to connect to
        Kiryu's side in Yakuza 3 as a result of being his motivation, resulting in several cutscenes and minigames
        which
        left him mixed feelings. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/why-i-love-kazuma-kiryus-suit-yakuza/">Anthony John
            Agnello from GamesRadar</a> praised Kiryu's initial appearance alongside
        his personality. Matt Kim from <a
            href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/community-question-whos-your-favorite-dad-in-video-games">US
            Gamer</a> said Kiryu was his favorite paternal figure in gaming due to how
        caring he is to Haruka and to people in general despite his connections with the yakuza. <a
            href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2017/01/feature_5_reasons_why_kazuma_kiryu_is_the_hardest_man_on_playstation">Push
            Square</a> listed
        him as one of the best characters seen in PlayStation games based on his skills in combat and sense of
        justice. The character's rivalry with Yakuza 2 antagonist Ryuji Goda was also the subject of positive
        response even if some writers felt it underused.</p>

    <p>On a more critical view, Greg Kasavin from <a
            href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-review/1900-6157009/">GameSpot</a> stated that while Kiryu
        often resorts to profanity "he's
        your prototypical hero taking on your prototypical villains." <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608165721/http://www.1up.com/features/liberty-arrived-gta4-infamous-prototype?pager.offset=2">1UP.com</a>
        called him "a hard-boiled thug"
        comparing him with characters like Niko and Alex Mercer due to his inhuman powers. They further noted that
        his
        powers can be "ridiculous." Real life yakuza Midoriyama commented on the character during <a
            href="https://boingboing.net/2010/08/10/yakuza-3-review.html">a review of the
            third game</a> that "Kiryu is the way yakuza used to be. We kept the streets clean. People liked us. We
        didn't
        bother ordinary citizens. We respected our bosses. Now, guys like that only exist in video games." In a
        Famitsu <a
            href="https://www.webcitation.org/6i8KLI3kn?url=http://www.1up.com/news/snake-beats-mario-coolest-video">poll</a>
        from 2010, Kiryu was voted as the eleventh best video game character. In a retrospective of the
        series, GameSpot compared Kiryu with Michael Corleone, the protagonist of the novel The Godfather by Mario
        Puzo.
        GameSpot noted that while Kiryu was featured with pacifistic traits as he wishes to have a peaceful life
        with
        Haruka, he still has violent traits as he has no problems with beating up enemies across the series. In
        addition
        to Kiryu's story, the site also commented on how well developed were from clunky to more unique as latter
        games
        in the franchise included new characters with different fighting styles. Colin Campbell from <a
            href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/11/27/20974490/greatest-video-game-characters-2019-2010-skyrim-witcher-splatoon">Polygon</a>
        praised
        his heroic traits explored when dealing with multiple yakuzas.</p>

    <p>Critics have also noted Kiryu was handled different in the prequel Yakuza 0 and had mixed feelings on its
        execution. Anime News Network writer <a
            href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-08-25/everything-you-need-to-know-about-yakuza/.119814">Dustin
            Bailey</a> praised Kiryu's role in Yakuza 0 saying that while in
        most of the games he was portrayed as a "saintly Superman", in the prequel he enjoyed seeing the character
        involved
        in darker scenarios. As a result, he found the PlayStation 3 Yakuza games less interesting due to a focus on
        Kiryu's struggle for a peaceful life, but, conversely, found Yakuza 5 to be more unique due to its inclusion
        of bizarre enemies for Kiryu to fight, most notably a bear. Due to Majima showing a different characterization
        in the prequel, writers found him more interesting than Kiryu. <a
            href="https://egmnow.com/yakuza-0-review/">EGMNOW</a> liked the contrast the duo
        had in the narrative because of the different quests they had to pass to achieve their goals. <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127005102/http://www.thejimquisition.com/yakuza-0-review/">The
            Jimquisition</a> said that both characters were "like-able protagonists who consistently have to act as
        straight
        men in a variety of weird situations".</p>

    <p>As multiple games involved Kiryu returning to the yakuza life despite his retirement in the first game,
        <a
            href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-yakuza-series-before-yakuza-6">USGamer</a>
        criticized this recycling format and expected Yakuza 6 follow the true end of Kiryu's arc. For the review of
        Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, <a href="http://www.uk-anime.net/games/Yakuza_6:_The_Song_of_Life.html">UK Anime
            Network</a> believed Sega managed to close Kiryu's story in an appealing
        despite his interactions with Haruto, an infant Kiryu looks after across the game. <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180318053355/https://www.destructoid.com/review-yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-492903.phtml">Destructoid</a>
        liked the
        handling of Kiryu, due to his more serious personality caused by Haruka's crisis. GameInformer felt that the
        narrative gave the character an <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180323223235/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/15/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-game-informer-review.aspx">appropriate</a>
        closure even if it is sad. GameRevolution shared similar
        comments, mainly on how Haruka also has been developing in previous games to stay close to her adoptive
        father and it was this time Kiryu's quest to protect her. GameSpot noted the game touched deep themes as Kiryu
        often interacted with families, making it fitting for <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180318053352/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-review-a-hard-boiled-old/1900-6416875/">his
            final game</a> with him as the main character. Kotaku
        claimed while Haruka's newfound happiness with Haruto serves an positive note to close Kiryu's arc, the fact
        that Kiryu survives after receiving mortal wounds and leaves reduced the tension the player has.

    <section><h3>Popularity</h3>
        <p>In a <a
        href="https://www.siliconera.com/yakuza-series-popularity-poll-shows-its-current-top-20-favorite-characters/">popularity
        poll</a> from 2018 by Sega, Kiryu took the 2nd position behind Goro Majima. Because Yakuza has a
    long running history of being PlayStation exclusive, Kazuma Kiryu is often recognized as a PlayStation
    mascot.

    In promoting Kai Razor and Yakuza: Dead Souls, Kiryu's image was used in the razor. Kiryu also uses such razor
    during a scene from Of the End. Sega also sponsored <a
        href="https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/194-man-wins-kazuma-kiryus-9000-back-tattoo">a contest</a> where the
    winner would get Kiryu's $9000
    tattoo. The winner was Fari Salievski. The process took sixth months to complete. Salivevski commented "Well, my
    nickname is now "The Dragon"... Whilst in Thailand, I had people coming up to me and taking photos, other cam
    round wondering what all the fuss was about thinking I am some kind of celebrity. I could not stop laughing! my
    Facebook page gets a lot of comments too."

    Kazuma Kiryu was requested as a guest character in Bandai Namco's fighting game <a
        href="https://tekkengamer.com/2017/04/18/top-guest-characters-suggested-katsuhiro-harada-tekken-7/">Tekken
        7</a>. Katsuhiro Harada,
    the producer of Tekken 7 and director of the series, stated that he was taken aback by the amount of demand
    there was for the character in the West. Even after the revealed guest characters were Geese Howard and
    Noctis Lucis Caelum, fans took to Twitter to express their enthusiasm in having Kiryu included in the game.
    Yakuza producer Daisuke Sato stated that "As far as it comes down to the whole Tekken thing, if Harada-san
    actually says he wants to use Kiryu, then there it is."

    In speaking to Red Bull France in an interview, Sega's chief creative officer <a
        href="https://tojodojo.com/yakuza-creator-nagoshi-apprehensive-about-putting-kiryu-in-fighting-games/">Toshihiro
        Nagoshi</a> had this to say
    in regard to Kiryu joining the Tekken roster: "We do get this request a lot. Of course there are exceptions, but
    fighting games generally have female characters, and personally I donât really want to see Kiryu beating up
    women."</p></section>
