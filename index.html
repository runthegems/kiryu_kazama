        <p>Kazuma Kiryu (Japanese: <i lang="jpn">桐生 一馬</i>, Hepburn: <i lang="jpn-Latn">Kiryū Kazuma</i>) is a fictional
            character and the main protagonist in Sega's action-adventure Japanese role-playing game series <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(series)">Yakuza</a>. He was introduced in the 2005 game with
            the same
            name as fearsome yakuza nicknamed "the Dragon of Dojima" (<i lang="jpn">堂島の龍</i>, <i lang="jpn-Latn">Dōjima
                no
                Ryū</i>). Kiryu takes the blame for his boss' death to protect his best friend Akira Nishikiyama,
            resulting in
            his expulsion from the clan and a ten-year stay in prison. After leaving prison, Kiryu learns the crime
            world has
            changed and fights against the new threats in his life. He is voiced by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaya_Kuroda">Takaya Kuroda</a> in Japanese and by <a
                href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Kurylo>Darryl
                Kurylo</a> in the English version of the first game which he reprises 15 years later for <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza:_Like_a_Dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>. Besides
            the two Yakuza live-action films, the character has also appeared in other video game including <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_X_Zone_2">Project X Zone 2</a> and
            as downloadable content in <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_the_North_Star:_Lost_Paradise">Fist of the North Star: Lost
                Paradise</a>.</p>

        <p>Sega producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshihiro_Nagoshi">Toshihiro Nagoshi</a> created Kiryu
            alongside novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hase_Seish%C5%AB">Hase Seishu</a>. Nagoshi stated
            he was created to
            appeal to a broad audience, and was the series' playable character during its first three games. As the next
            games
            relied on multiple characters, Kiryu took a smaller role in these games. However, the installment <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_6:_The_Song_of_Life">Yakuza 6: The Song
                of Life</a> was meant to conclude Kiryu's role in the franchise.</p>

        <p>Several have praised how Kiryu, despite identifying as a yakuza, stood out because of his kindness and
            character
            development across the series' story. On the other hand, he has also been viewed as a somewhat typical
            gaming
            protagonist. Critical reception to Kiryu has been generally positive, and he is often considered a
            PlayStation
            mascot.</p>
