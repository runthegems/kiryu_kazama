        <h3>Creation and Development</h3>
        <p>Writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshihiro_Nagoshi">Toshihiro Nagoshi</a> created Kazuma Kiryu with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hase_Seish%C5%AB">Hasei Seishu</a>'s aid.
    In creating Kazuma Kiryu, there were some issues regarding how realistic his position and age were. Writer Hasei
    Seishu told the staff the positions were too high for his age and thus Kiryu's age was revised. When describing
    Kiryu, the staff found his position would be of the noble samurai type who would often protect others. According
    to Sega producer Toshihiro Nagoshi, dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they
    would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character. Although Kiryu is
    the player character for Yakuza, Nagoshi refrained from calling him the protagonist as the narrative was focused on
    the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruka_Sawamura">Haruka Sawamura</a> who has a character arc instead in the game. The same basis was used for Yakuza 2
    where the narrative focuses more on the new character Kaoru Sayama rather than Kiryu.</p>

    <p>When the spin-off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%AB_ga_Gotoku_Kenzan!">Yakuza Kenzan</a> was released, he commented that the tale of Kazuma Kiryu had yet to be completed. As
    a result, he had Kiryu and Haruka trying to live a "more 'human' life" throughout Yakuza 3. For this game
    Toshihiro Nagoshi stated Kiryu was highly different from an iconic hero as a result of the way he enjoys his life.
    Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the
    team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for
    Yakuza 3 was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to
    prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game. Due to Kiryu taking
    care of the orphans, Yokoyama feared the character became too kind.</p>

    <p>Across all these games, the development team developed a sturdy understanding of his personality, and there was a
    lot of effort put into making the character attractive to the audiences as a result of being the only playable
    character. By Yakuza 4, Kiryu was seen as "indestructible" by the staff, and as a result, he was made the last
    character playable in the game, following three new characters that stood out thanks to their different traits.
    In localizing the games, the character was often referred to by his first name, but by Yakuza 4, producer Yasuhiro
    Noguchi made him most commonly called Kiryu in an attempt to make him fit with the other main characters also called
    by their last names. For Yakuza 5, while once again there were other protagonists alongside Kiryu, a new one,
    Haruka, was added as playable for the first time in order to make her character arc connect with the role of Kiryu
    and the other characters. Kiryu was made into a taxi driver but in a new city where he is not known by other people,
    this was done by the staff as they thought it would be the best choice for him.</p>

    <p>For the prequel Yakuza 0 Sega wanted to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goro_Majima">Majima</a> stand out from the Kiryu as in this title the two share the role
    of protagonists. Sega described Kiryu as a "straight man trait – tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit"
    implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game,
    Kiwami, the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the
    franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions
    while being both friends and enemies at the same time. Yakuza 0 also served as a story of Kiryu that Sega wanted
    players to know before reaching Yakuza 6. Kiryu's traits in Yakuza 0 were specifically changed to a
    "loose-cannon hot-head" to the point long time fans would be surprised by his actions. However, chief Masayoshi
    Yokoyama stated the character would mature across the storyline. Despite Kiryu's fame, Sato noted that players
    ended up enjoying Majima far more in the franchise.</p>

    <p>During development of Yakuza 4, the staff started wondering how would they end Kiryu's story as, unlike other video
    game characters, he did not possess supernatural powers. They compared the character with James Bond whose actor
    changed multiple times across his movies. Describing him as "a super-cool and masculine guy, but since he's a
    well-established character with a specific personality, there are things that he would and wouldn't do" the team
    decided he would need a successor who would bring the staff more creativity to work with. In late 2016, Nagoshi
    claimed he had been doing Kazuma's story for nearly a decade, stating "it had its pros and cons". He concluded
    saying "I also think that's a way to give back to Kazuma Kiryu. Sooner or later, I want to announce something
    different." In April 2017 Sega confirmed that while Yakuza 6 will end Kiryu's story, the series will still go
    on. Deciding to bring the last tale Kiryu with Yakuza 6, the staff wanted to do the game as appealing as
    possible. The game focuses on the family relationship between Kiryu and Haruka after years of being
    separated.</p></section>
    
    <section><h3>Voice Actors</h3>
    
    <p>English voice actor <a href="https://tojohq.github.io/interview-darryl-kurylo/">Darryl Kurylo</a> said that he wanted to sound as good as possible after being impressed by the
    characterization of Kiryu and the lines he had to give. However, he regrets some lines were lost in translation of
    the original game. Nevertheless, Kurylo enjoyed the experience to the point of playing the game multiple times
    alongside his son. In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in
    different styles. Kurylo still found more fun when doing the yells for the fight scenes.</p>

    <p>Nogashi was impressed by Kiryu's Japanese voice actor, Takaya Kuroda, due to how he sang in the music minigame.
    Another staff member, Sato, was impressed by the karaoke game as it helped to show a fun side of Kiryu. Kuroda
    highly enjoyed voicing his character, being anxious in most scenes regardless of the tone he had to make. As a
    result, he wants to keep Kiryu in character. Kuroda describes Kiryu as a true shy character, stating he does not
    consider himself too attractive to the point he could not form a formal romantic relationship with Sayama in Yakuza
    2. Kuroda was surprised with the success of the first Yakuza game and thus hoped the series would continue.
    Kuroda expressed joy with his work as he recalls people who distinguished his voice from the games.</p></section>
